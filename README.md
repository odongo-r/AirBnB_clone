# AirBnB Clone

## Description
This project is a simplified version of the AirBnB website. It involves the creation of a command-line interface (CLI) to manage AirBnB objects and implement various features such as serialization, deserialization, and file storage.

## Command Interpreter
The command interpreter allows users to interact with the AirBnB objects via a command-line interface. Below are instructions on how to start and use the interpreter:

### How to Start
To start the command interpreter, run the `console.py` script.

$ ./console.py


### How to Use
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use various commands to manage AirBnB objects. Type `help` to see a list of available commands and their descriptions.

### Examples
Here are some examples of commands you can use in the command interpreter:

(hbnb) create User
(hbnb) show User 1234-5678
(hbnb) update Place 1234-5678 name "New Place"
(hbnb) all
(hbnb) quit
